//! The main module and entrypoint
//!
//! Various facilities of the kernels are implemented as submodules. The most
//! important ones are:
//!
//! - [`trap`]: Handles all cases of switching from userspace to the kernel
//! - [`syscall`]: System call handling and implementation
//!
//! The operating system also starts in this module. Kernel code starts
//! executing from `entry.asm`, after which [`rust_main()`] is called to
//! initialize various pieces of functionality. (See its source code for
//! details.)
//!
//! We then call [`batch::run_next_app()`] and for the first time go to
//! userspace.
