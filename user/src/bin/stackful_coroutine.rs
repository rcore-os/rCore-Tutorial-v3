/// saved when we suspended exceution on the "new" task.
///
/// This is essentially all we need to do to save and resume execution.
///
/// Some details about inline assembly.
///
/// The assembly commands in the string literal is called the assemblt template. It is preceeded by
/// zero or up to four segments indicated by ":":
///
/// - First ":" we have our output parameters, this parameters that this function will return.
/// - Second ":" we have the input parameters which is our contexts. We only read from the "new" context
/// but we modify the "old" context saving our registers there (see volatile option below)
/// - Third ":" This our clobber list, this is information to the compiler that these registers can't be used freely
/// - Fourth ":" This is options we can pass inn, Rust has 3: "alignstack", "volatile" and "intel"
///
/// For this to work on windows we need to use "alignstack" where the compiler adds the neccesary padding to
/// make sure our stack is aligned. Since we modify one of our inputs, our assembly has "side effects"
/// therefore we should use the `volatile` option. I **think** this is actually set for us by default
/// when there are no output parameters given (my own assumption after going through the source code)
/// for the `asm` macro, but we should make it explicit anyway.
///
/// One last important part (it will not work without this) is the #[naked] attribute. Basically this lets us have full
/// control over the stack layout since normal functions has a prologue-and epilogue added by the
/// compiler that will cause trouble for us. We avoid this by marking the funtion as "Naked".
/// For this to work on `release` builds we also need to use the `#[inline(never)] attribute or else
/// the compiler decides to inline this function (curiously this currently only happens on Windows).
/// If the function is inlined we get a curious runtime error where it fails when switching back
/// to as saved context and in general our assembly will not work as expected.
